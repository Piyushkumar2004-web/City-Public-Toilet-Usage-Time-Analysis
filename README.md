 🚻 City Public Toilet Usage Time Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **public toilet usage patterns in a city** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
The goal is to identify **peak usage hours** and propose **optimized maintenance schedules** to improve cleanliness and efficiency.

This project is developed as part of **Minor–1 (EDA Project)**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze toilet usage across different times of the day
- Identify **peak and low usage hours**
- Visualize usage trends using **line plots**
- Detect peak hours automatically
- Suggest **maintenance scheduling** based on usage patterns

---

## 🧩 Project Features
- Synthetic dataset generation (if real data not available)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Hourly and daily usage analysis
- Line plots for time-based trends
- Peak detection logic
- Real-world maintenance recommendations

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

| Column Name   | Description |
|--------------|------------|
| Datetime     | Date and time of usage |
| Toilet_ID    | Unique toilet identifier |
| Usage_Count  | Number of users |

---

## 📈 Analysis Performed
- Average usage per hour
- Total daily usage
- Line plot of usage vs hour
- Peak hour detection using statistical threshold
- Maintenance scheduling based on peak hours

---

## 🧼 Maintenance Scheduling Logic
| Usage Period | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Before Peak | Routine cleaning |
| During Peak | Staff availability |
| After Peak  | Deep cleaning |
| Low Usage   | Repairs & inspection |

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Public toilet usage peaks during **morning and evening hours**
- Cleaning should be scheduled **before peak times**
- Proper scheduling improves hygiene and reduces operational cost

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository from :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
Open the notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Run all cells to view analysis and plots

📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how EDA and time-based analysis can be used to solve real-world urban problems.
Optimized maintenance scheduling based on usage patterns can significantly improve public hygiene and resource management.
